# Epic screenshot

Epic screenshot is a Chrome extension for taking screenshots of video on any site.

## Details

Press `Ctrl+Shift+S` or `Cmd+Shift+S` or `Alt+Shift+S` to take the screenshot.

On some sites, these combos may not work, instead you can use `Ctrl+Shift+.` or `Cmd+Shift+.` or `Alt+Shift+.` or `Ctrl+Shift+,` or `Cmd+Shift+,` or `Alt+Shift+,`.
